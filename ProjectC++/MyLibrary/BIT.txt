 * To move to parent at query : index -= index & (-index).
 * Update range [l,r] with value v using to bit:
 * 		1) Update first one at index l with v.
 * 		2) Update first one at index r+1 with -v.
 * 		3) Update second one at index l with v*(a-1).
 * 		4) Update second one at index r+1 with -v*b.
